\section*{Abstract}
This report details the development of an online parser, evaluator, and visualiser for a subset of the Haskell language to help users learn concepts in functional programming that are often foreign to those coming from an imperative background. The visualiser allows a user to program their own functions, data types, and type classes, and then visualise them step by step until fully evaluated. The online tool ensures the user's program is correct by performing type checking and type inference on the given program, both before and during evaluation. We evaluate the visualiser's success against how well it aided a small group of students, and provide further insights on how it could be improved.
