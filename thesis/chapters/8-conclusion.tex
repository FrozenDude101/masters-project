\section{Conclusion} \label{conclusion}
This project aimed to help address the problem of learning functional programming, and has successfully done so by creating a visualiser for Haskell that allows a user to see a program evaluate step by step, as well as see the type information of expressions within that program. While not covering all the features of modern GHC Haskell, I feel the project has been a success as I was able to implement the major features I wanted, namely functions, data types, and type classes, so they can evaluate and be visualised in a useful way to the user.
